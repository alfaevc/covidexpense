# Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dominated 2020 and it still impacts Everyone's life. People limits their travel times beacuse of the travel ban and more people prefer private transportation than public transportation to prevent exposure to croweds. In [Statistical Insights: Consumption shifts and inflation measurement during COVID-19](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/statistical-insights-consumption-shifts-and-inflation-measurement-during-covid-19.htm), the author mentions about the CPI changes as a result of COVID-19. This interests us to investigate whethre COVID-19 increases people's living expenses.

In this project, we would focus on CPI data collected from [U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS](https://beta.bls.gov/labs/) and the COVID-19 cases data from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) to find the correalations between CPI and Covid Cases. We would like to discuss this problem from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions:

1. How COVID-19 cases development in the US?

2. Did CPI index increase after Covid breakout? Which items's CPI change most after COVID-19?

3. Why this item correlates with COVID-19 most?
   -How did Covid affect the sales of this item?
   -Did the production of this item change as a result of COVID-19?
