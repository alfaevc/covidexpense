### Description

For this project we are primarily interested in investigating the variation of living expenses since the Covid-19 breakout. We firstly want to investigate whether the CPI index has increased after Covid breakout and the dominant sector, so that we can induce the price change's influence on Covid-19 break. On top of that, we are also keen to find out demand's effect on the price, where covid's effect on the sales of the dominant sector and the possible norms associated with the covid-relevant dominant sector are useful for investigation. Finally, we want to analyse supply's effect on the price by exploring whether the cost of production o transportation or both of them have significant correlation with the pandemic.
