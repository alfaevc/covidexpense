People limits their travel times beacuse of the travel ban and more people prefer private transportation than public transportation to prevent exposure to croweds. In Statistical Insights: Consumption shifts and inflation measurement during COVID-19, the author mentions about the CPI changes as a result of COVID-19. This interests us to investigate whethre COVID-19 increases people’s living expenses. In this project, we would focus on CPI data collected from U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS and the COVID-19 cases data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find the correalations between CPI and Covid Cases. We would like to discuss this problem from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions: How COVID-19 cases development in the US? Did CPI index increase after Covid breakout? Which items’s CPI change most after COVID-19? Why this item correlates with COVID-19 most? -How did Covid affect the sales of this item? -Did the production of this item change as a result of COVID-19?

BLS is the abbreviation of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, where it provides public API to help people access the data. Price indexes are available for the U.S., the four Census regions, nine Census divisions, two size of city classes, eight cross-classifications of regions and size-classes, and for 23 local areas. Indexes are available for major groups of consumer expenditures (food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communications, and other goods and services), for items within each group, and for special categories, such as services. We chose Chained CPI-ALL Urban Consumers as our indicator of living expense. It is introduced to better estimate the real living expense of people compare to classic CPI. The data is collected using API. The item codes was used to generate API requests. After running for loop with each [item codes], we saved our data to a public googlesheet so as to help others access the data more conveniently. The data we used is monthly data as mentioned in official introduction. 2.2 Bureau of Transportation Statistics Monthly Transportation Statistics dataset is a collection of national statistical data on transportation. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics brings together the latest data from across the Federal government and transportation industry. Monthly Transportation Statistics contains over 50 time series from nearly two dozen data sources. Apart from the Date attribute in the character format, it has 134 numeric transportation attributes(e.g. Highway fatalities, highway vehicle miles traveled for all systems, etc.), where we are specifically interested in U.S. Airline Traffic - Total - Seasonally Adjusted that records the the total number of passengers travelling by air from Jan 1947 to Jul 2021 in a monthly basis(We need both international and domestic passengers since they both have potential contributions to covid cases). However, lots of the attributes including our target have lots of missing values, U.S. Airline Traffic - Total - Seasonally Adjusted has no record prior to Jan 2017 in particular, which is not a major problem since we are only interested in air travel records from recent years. The data can be directly downloaded from https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Monthly-Transportation-Statistics/crem-w557. 2.3 U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil The oil data records the monthly field production of crude Oil thousand barrels from Jan 1920 to Sep 2021, where the attributes Month and U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil Thousand Barrels per Day are in the character and numeric format respectively. We would potentially trim the data before Jan 2017 in order to match the scope of the transportation statistics data above. This data is also directly downloaded from https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=A 2.4 United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State overTime The covid data is collected by the centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), which reports aggregate counts of daily confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases and death numbers online for different states in the US. There are 5 character variables, where the submission_date and created_at are supposed to be converted to date variable types and state contains the abbreviation of all states in the US. The other 10 are numeric variables, including confirmed total cases and death, probable total cases and death, confirmed new cases and death etc. There are only few missing reported cases for this data, so it would be reasonable to replace them with 0s given that we would combine the daily cases to monthly cases for each state via using sum. However, some attributes such as confirmed cases have negative values, which makes no sense in a real world setting and it’s definitely our concern to remove or replace them using some tactics. This is one of the main datasets of interest where we want to explore how the variation of covid cases affect CPI trends. More details are on the website where the data is downloaded: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36.

Since all attributes are in the string format, it’s helpful to convert the item names into the factor type since we are interested in comparing time series for different items and cpi values into numeric values. We also create a new date attribute by concetenating year and month to get the full range of time series, which is further converted into the yearmon type. Finally, we create another data cpi_monthly.csv by pivot_wider to obtain monthly cpi values for all item names such that the number of observations are equivalent to the number of distinct year-months.

We also noticed that for the attributes consent_cases andconsent_deaths some NAs are denoted as the string 'N\\A', where it makes sense to replace them with actual NA since they are indeed missing values. In addition, we want to investigate cross state covid cases, where we want to focus on 50 main states. In particular, we have 60 states in total and the reported observations for New York City and Washington D.C. are separated from New York and Maryland respectively, where other states are disjoint from the 50. Hence, we adjust the observations for New York City and Washington D.C. and add them to New York and Maryland in cdcmonth.csv respectively. Furthermore, we replace the NAs in probable cases and deaths with 0s and further replace confirmed cases and deaths with total cases - probable cases and total deaths - probable deaths since some of the confirmed cases and deaths are &lt; 0 as mentioned in section 2 and probable cases are considered to be unreliable records. We have also created 3 new datasets cdc_all.csv, cdc_monthly_all_state.csv and data_monthly.csv, where cdc_all.csv is obtained from getting the daily reported cases and deaths for the entire US by summing over the cases and death across all the states, then we further shrink the data to the national monthly cases and deaths cdc_monthly_all_state.csv by grouping the data by each month. We eventually merge cdc_monthly_all_state.csv and cpi_monthly.csv obtained above to conduct analysis between covid and cpi attributes as well as performing visualizations such as plotting us maps. ## # A tibble: 6 × 15 ## submission_date state tot_cases conf_cases prob_cases new_case pnew_case tot_death conf_death prob_death new_death ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 04/01/2021 CA 3570660 3570660 0 2234 0 58090 58090 0 154 ## 2 05/31/2021 CA 3685032 3685032 0 644 0 62011 62011 0 5 ## 3 02/06/2020 NE 0 NA NA 0 NA 0 NA NA 0 ## 4 07/30/2020 ME 3910 3497 413 22 2 123 122 1 2 ## 5 02/02/2021 MS 280182 176228 103954 1059 559 6730 4739 1991 13 ## 6 05/03/2020 NH 2518 NA NA 89 0 86 NA NA 2 ## # … with 4 more variables: pnew_death &lt;dbl&gt;, created_at &lt;chr&gt;, consent_cases &lt;chr&gt;, consent_deaths &lt;chr&gt; ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## new_case new_death date state statefull ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 227 3 2020-4 AK Alaska ## 2 4871 1 2021-4 AK Alaska ## 3 2297 19 2020-8 AK Alaska ## 4 12078 49 2021-8 AK Alaska ## 5 13978 76 2020-12 AK Alaska ## 6 0 0 2020-2 AK Alaska ## # A tibble: 6 × 7 ## year period periodName value seriesID item_name date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;yearmon&gt; ## 1 2021 M10 October 155.

Missing values plot for United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State overTime: Overall, there are only 21 distinct missing pattern for nearly 40000 rows of data. In particular, less than half of the rows are complete cases. Total confirmed death, total probable death, total probable cases and total confirmed cases have the highest numbers of missing data, where the percent of missing values are roughly identical to about 20 percent. These four variables often have missing values at the same time. Around 15 percent of total rows only have these four variables missing at the same time. Percent of missing consent cases and consent deaths are roughly identical. Pecent of missing new probable cases and new probable deaths are also roughly identical. The missing percentage for these four variables are also significant, but they are a lot lower than the previous four attributes, where all other attributes have no missing data. There are also some correlations between variables. Consent cases and consent death variable indicates if the state consent to disclosure the data on cases and deaths. There are three values: ‘agree’, ‘not agree’ and NA (the missing value). After understanding the variable, we found that when consent cases is missing, total probable cases and total confirmed cases are missing as well. Same thing happen to consent deaths， total probable deaths and total confirmed deaths. Therefore, after the missing value analysis, we can conclude that missing values in consent cases and consent deaths is equivalent to ‘not agree’. And now the consent cases and consent death can be translate to a logical variable having 0 and 1 as values.

Today, the cumulative Covid cases in U.S. has passed 40 million. The first two plots will show our audiences how Covid develops as time passed. 5.1.1.1 Cumulative Total Cases Covid started in March 2020 and has highest increase speed around the winter 2020. In the first half year, Covid cases number has surge to 5 million from 0. And it further increase to 25 million in the next half year. The increase of Covid cases is exponential as people would go social and the spreading of Virus also has ‘Network Effect’. 5.1.1.2 Daily New Cases The daily new cases plot further proved what we mentioned before. In winter 2020, the holidays helped the virus to spread in U.S.. Beside, the cold weather helped the Virus to live longer in the environment. Promoting and limiting social activities afterward definitely helped. Combining with warmer weather, summer 2021 has very low number of new cases. 5.2 Covid Development in Different States Here we compared how new cases and total cases change from 1976 to 2020 by state so as to see how Covid development differs in different location. Instructions to use the graph: Play/pause clicking the play/pause button Navigate the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb Navigate the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys. From the motion map, we can see that the first five cases in the United States come from Illinois State, Washington State and Arizona State. At the beginning, California and New York state has the most new cases which are two of the largest States that have the most population. From Jun 2020 to Sep 2020, California, Texas and Florida States have the most new cases. Then New York comes with them to have the most new cases. Because the population for these states are really large which increases the spread of Coronavirus disease. From the motion map, we can find that at first, New York is the state with the largest total cases and then from Jul 2020 until Nov 2021, California, Texas and Flora are the three States that have the largest total cases which compatible with the trend of new cases from the previous motion map. These three States have large populations and warm weather which provides with enough condition for Coronavirus to live and spread. 5.3 Clustering States by Covid Trend To identify difference and similarities between Covid case curves, we estimated a basis spline (B-spline) model for every state. Each estimated B-spline is a weighted piecewise combination of 10 polynomials, connected at “knots”. Estimated splines and weight coefficients are closely related in states with similar underlying case curves. We compared the estimated state splines by using the K-means algorithm to cluster similar sets of weight coefficients, identifying groups of states with similar Covid case trajectories. In general, we can observe that the coefficients for two states in the same cluster are more similar than those in a different cluster(e.g. Florida and Texas). The plotted trend line further proved the clustering model did a great job grouping stats. For instance, California, Florida and Texas are grouped together. Those states are in south of U.S. indicating a warmer weather which would help virus to stay alive longer in the environment. Moreover, their population are much larger than other states. The high population density also helps virus to spread and make the data in those states differ from others. Other groups showed above have geographical, population density, and policy similarities which lead to the similar trend. 5.4 Consumer Price Index Development We utilized chained consumer price index to reflect the change in our living expenses. We will discover the item that had highest increase in price after Covid broke out. We will analysis their similarities with Covid development. 5.4.1 Chang of Living Expenses by Items From the bar plot, we can see that public transportation is the only one that decreases the CPI after the Covid-19. Because of the Covid-19, many people avoided using pubilic transportation which is crowded. The decrease of demands decreased the CPI. In the opposite, private transportation, Energy and transportation CPI increases a lot after the Covid-19 comparing with the change rates before the Covid-19. More people choose to use private transportation to reduce the chance of exposure to the crowds. We already know that energy is a necessity for private transportation. The increase of demands on these three products increases the CPI at the same time. Durable goods is the one that has negative change in CPI before the Covid-19 and then increases sharply after the Covid-19. We know that during the Covid-19, people are forced to stay at home and this may be the reason that people bought lots of durable goods as they spent less outdoor. Moreover, the increase in Energy lead to the manufacturing and transportation cost to increase which leads to a higher price of goods in the store. 5.4.2 All Items’ Price Trend Here we put all CPI items together for display so that we can know how the trend look like. The graph visualization is not idea and may not be informative. We will solve the problem and apply scaling, grouping, and correlation analysis on those data so as to draw useful insights and clear graphs. 5.4.3 Correlation Between Consumer Items From the first graph with all CPI items, it is hard for us to tell clearly how each one moves. And by their names and our common sense, it is very likely that some of them share similar trend. Therefore, we decided to use a heat map to represent their correlations so that we can evaluate their similarities quantitatively. Our purpose here is to find similarities and group similar ones so that we can find the main cause of higher prices easier. According to the heat map, we can easily tell that many of the CPI items are highly and positively correlated with each other. However, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities, Communication, and Apparel showed white and red color in the heat map. This indicates that they are not or negatively correlated with other items. Combining with the trend graph, I know that their prices did not increase much. It is also reasonable because some of them have pricing mechanism that is not determined by the market. For instance, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities and Communication have government set prices and fixed prices. Energy are highly correlated with some other industrial and transportation related items. According to the heatmap, I would group the following items together: Energy, Commodities, Transportation, Private Transportation, Durables and Fuel and Utilities. The rest of items are Food, Education, Housing, Medical Care Services and Recreation. Their correlation are higher than 0.8 indicating a high correlation between them. Their prices are highly affected by labor cost in services area. Since our living expenses increased, people working at services industry would need higher salaries and results in higher price for services. Moreover, their correlation with Energy is relatively low. Just like I explained before, it would take time to have effect on those prices. People would first feel the living expense to increase before they ask for higher salary. The delaying effect caused the correlation between them and Energy to be low. Therefore, we grouped similar CPI items together and will show their similarities in the next part. 5.4.4 Group CPI Items The groups we created for CPI items are as follows: 1. Price Stable Items: Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities, Communication, and Apparel 2. Energy Related Items: Energy, Commodities, Transportation, Private Transportation, Durables and Fuel and Utilities 3. Labor Related Goods: Food, Education, Housing, Medical Care Services and Recreation In order to confirm their similarities, their trend lines are plotted together below. Since their base values are different, the difference in scale would cause some trends not as obvious as others with larger scale. The standardized method is used here to showcase the similarities better. From the scaled trend lines, it proves that our grouping did a pretty good job! Price Stable Items had price drop since early 2019 and started to rise in price after mid 2020. Energy Related Items had a increase trend in early 2019 and had a huge drop after Covid broke out and increase in price afterwards dramatically. Labor Related Items had a general increasing trend since 2019, and had a higher slop after Covid broke out. The last graph showed one item from each of three groups to showcase their difference in trend as response to the Covid development. According to the trends of different groups, Energy Related Items are more interesting to us. Their price dropped a lot after Covid just broke out. And then, the price increased dramatically after the first several months. Other goods, doesn’t seem to have such big impact from Covid. Therefore, we think Energy Related Items will be the target we will further investigate so as to discover how Covid caused our living expense to increase. 5.5 Covid’s Impact on Energy Price Index 5.5.1 Covid &amp; Energy Trend Comparison We have scaled the data so as to make their changes obvious and comparable. At beginning of 2020, Energy started to drop from 0 which is its mean to over -1.5 times its standard deviation. At the end of 2020, though Total Cases was still growing, Energy price started to recover and increase to higher level than before Covid broke out. 5.5.2 Change of Energy Price Index Next, we are going to investigate the probable reason that Covid could cause Energy price to change like what we discovered. We would discuss the cause from supply perspective and demand perspective. 5.5.2.1 Demand Side Analysis Before the Covid-19, the travel number increase steadily until February 2020. At the begining of the Covid-19 spread out, from February 2020 to April 2020, the travel decreases sharply which follows the tread that CPI for energy decreases sharply from Jan 2020 to March 2020, and then CPI for energy rises a little in July 2020, stay until Dec 2020, and a slight decrease in Dec 2020. From the travel trend plot, we can also see that the travel number has a slow increase from April 2020 to February 2021. The CPI for energy and air travel number both increase from Jan 2021 until now. Travel takes large porpotion of energy consumption. As the travel needs decrease, the demand to the energy decreased at the early 2020. The increase in travel in late 2020 and 2021 lead to the increase in energy demand. Thus, stimulates the Energy price to increase. It is clear that people stop traveling and working from home at the early stage of Covid broke out. This lead to a huge decrease in number of travel passengers number. In later 2020, the number of travellers is 1/3 of the number in early 2020. People starts to go back to office and go on vacation in summer 2021 as the new cases number starts to drop and people can not stand the lives staying at home everyday any more. 5.5.2.2 Supply Side Analysis From the above line chart, we can see that before the covid-19, the supply of oil increases steadily. At the beginning of Covid broke out, from Mar 2020 to May 2020, the oil production decreases sharply which shares the same trend with travel number. The decrease of needs for travel leads to the decrease of needs for energy, results in the decrease of energy price and finally cause the decrease of supply. Then the production increases slowly to a relatively steady level. From the CPI of Energy plot and the travel number plot, we can see that both of them increases from Jan 2021 until now. The increase of needs for travel increases the demand for energy. The extra needs for energy and the shortage of energy production together make the energy price index surges.

In the analysis, we simply conclude the other items like Food, Housing and Services have delayed affect by the price increase of Energy. We assume people are experiencing higher living expense due to Energy related price increase, so they ask for higher salary which yields to higher price in Services. The limitation here is that we did not further analysis the other reasons caused the price to increase. For example, in order to overcome the pandemic, U.S. government utilized monetary easing policy which will naturally cause inflation. Though the government policy is also highly related with Covid pandemic, it is the area we did not have effort to dig in. Further insights could be drawn by analysis in that direction. Also, when talking about the supply of energy, we only used crude oil productions in the United States. Though USA is one of the top crude oil producers in the world, there are still many other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Canada which produce large amounts of crude oil as well. Besides, we focused on crude oil while electricity, gas, coal also contributes to the energy price index, collecting these items’ data and analyze their supply and demand may provide other insights. And we also discovered that even travel recovered later 2021, the production of crude oil did not recover. This might caused by higher price of crude oil leads to higher profit, but could also provide another direction for future discussion. In short, due to the time and effort limitation, we made some assumptions and chose the most significant change along the analysis. There are still many aspects that could be discussed to explain why would COVID-19 pandemic caused our living expenses to surge that much. We are looking forward to more analysis on this topic! 7.2 Lessons Learned From our project, we found that energy is a representative item which has high correlations with other items and COVID data. When investigating CPI change for energy, we found that the energy, air travel(demands of energy) and oil production(supply of energy) first decrease sharply as a result of COVID-19 because of the travel ban and then raises slowly. Later, the air travel recovered while oil production still remained low. The gaps between demands and supply leads to an increase of energy CPI. Two possible reasons that the oil production didn’t increase are incremental of total revenue gained by company due to higher prices and lack of labor due to the pandemic. There is definitely plenty of rooms for further investigations. During our project, we achieve a better understanding of data visualization and analysis. We learned to use API to obtain data from Internet which we haven’t tried before. Dealing with unknowns, using yearmon data to investigate time series problem. Selecting the best way to present data will make huge difference on what people receive from the graph and viz. It is not only to make graph beautiful and fancy, but also to make the graph intuitive and informative.
