[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CPI 5.2 Covid", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CPI CDC trend The above line chart shows the change of CPI for different items by time. Since there are so many items, we choose the ones we are most interested in to look more closely. We choose “energy”,“private transportation”, “private transportation”, “Commodities”, “new vehicles”, “public transportation”, and “communication” for futher discuss. Heatmap According to the heat map, we can easily tell that many of the CPI items are highly and positively correlated with each other. However, Public Transportation, Medical Care Services, Communication, and Apparel showed white and red color in the heat map. This indicates that they are not or negatively correlated with other items. Combining with the trend graph, I know that their prices did not increase much. It is also reasonable because some of them have pricing mechanism that is not determined by the market. For instance, Public Transportation, Medical Care Services and Communication We can see that the items can be divided into four groups from the above line chart. “energy”,“private transportation” and “transportation” decreases during the begining of covid-19 and then rises until now. “commodities” and “new vehicles” rises steadily. “public transportation” decreases slowly and then rise sharply during the start of 2021, then decrease sharply. “communication” almost no change. 5.2 Covid 5.2.1 new cases and total cases change by State from 2020 Jan to 2021 Nov We compared how new cases and total cases change from 1976 to 2020 by state Instructions to use the graph: Play/pause clicking the play/pause button Navigate the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb Navigate the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys. From the above motion map, we can see that the first five cases in the United States come from Illinois State, Washington State and Arizona State. At the beginning, California and New York state has the most new cases which are two of the largest States that have the most population. From Jun 2020 to Sep 2020, California, Texas and Florida States have the most new cases. Then New York comes with them to have the most new cases. Because the population for these states are really large which increases the spread of Coronavirus disease. From the motion map, we can find that at first, New York is the state with the largest total cases and then from Jul 2020 until Nov 2021, California, Texas and Florida are the three States that have the largest total cases which compatible with the trend of new cases from the previous motion map. These three States have large populations and warm weather which provides with enough condition for Coronavirus to live and spread. From the above two motion graphs, we have an opinion that the California, Texas and Florida have really similar trends. We would also like to know whether other states share the same trend. We are going to cluster the States into several regions by covid trend in the following sessions. 5.2.2 Correlation CPI V.S. Covid-19 Cases By looking at the pair-wise correlation between our variables(Covid data and CPI data), I am trying to use a quantitative method to find similar curves. Especially the curves that have similar trend as the total covid-19 cases.
