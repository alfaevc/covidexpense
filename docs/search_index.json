Since all attributes are in the string format, it’s helpful to convert the item names into the factor type since we are interested in comparing time series for different items and cpi values into numeric values. We also create a new date attribute by concetenating year and month to get the full range of time series, which is further converted into the yearmon type. ## # A tibble: 6 × 7 ## year period periodName value seriesID item_name date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;yearmon&gt; ## 1 2021 M10 October 155.

We also noticed that for the attributes consent_cases andconsent_deaths some NAs are denoted as the string 'N\\A', where it makes sense to replace them with actual NA since they are indeed missing values. Furthermore, we want to investigate cross state covid cases, where we want to focus on 50 main states. In particular, we have 60 states in total and the reported observations for New York City and Washington D.C. are separated from New York and Maryland respectively, where other states are disjoint from the 50. Hence, we adjust the observations for New York City and Washington D.C. and add them to New York and Maryland in cdcmonth.csv respectively. ## # A tibble: 6 × 15 ## submission_date state tot_cases conf_cases prob_cases new_case pnew_case tot_death conf_death prob_death ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 04/01/2021 CA 3570660 3570660 0 2234 0 58090 58090 0 ## 2 05/31/2021 CA 3685032 3685032 0 644 0 62011 62011 0 ## 3 02/06/2020 NE 0 NA NA 0 NA 0 NA NA ## 4 07/30/2020 ME 3910 3497 413 22 2 123 122 1 ## 5 02/02/2021 MS 280182 176228 103954 1059 559 6730 4739 1991 ## 6 05/03/2020 NH 2518 NA NA 89 0 86 NA NA ## # … with 5 more variables: new_death &lt;dbl&gt;, pnew_death &lt;dbl&gt;, created_at &lt;chr&gt;, consent_cases &lt;chr&gt;, ## # consent_deaths &lt;chr&gt; ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## new_case new_death date state statefull ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 227 3 2020-4 AK Alaska ## 2 4871 1 2021-4 AK Alaska ## 3 2297 19 2020-8 AK Alaska ## 4 12078 49 2021-8 AK Alaska ## 5 13978 76 2020-12 AK Alaska ## 6 0 0 2020-2 AK Alaska ## new_case new_death date state statefull ## 1 227 3 Apr 2020 AK Alaska ## 2 4871 1 Apr 2021 AK Alaska ## 3 2297 19 Aug 2020 AK Alaska ## 4 12078 49 Aug 2021 AK Alaska ## 5 13978 76 Dec 2020 AK Alaska ## 6 0 0 Feb 2020 AK Alaska 3.2.2 Travel 3.2.3 Oil 3.2.4 COVID-19 Vaccination and Case Trends by Age Group in United States ## # A tibble: 6 × 6 ## `Date Administered` AgeGroupVacc `7-day_avg_group_ca… Administered_Dose1_… Series_Complete_Po… date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM &lt;12 Years 6.80 0.075 0.003 2021-11-23 ## 2 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 12 - 15 Years 6.46 0.587 0.488 2021-11-23 ## 3 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 25 - 39 Years 7.59 0.716 0.609 2021-11-23 ## 4 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 40 - 49 Years 6.88 0.797 0.693 2021-11-23 ## 5 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 50 - 64 Years 5.81 0.869 0.764 2021-11-23 ## 6 11/22/2021 12:00:00 AM &lt;12 Years 9.35 0.075 0.003 2021-11-22 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing values plot for CPI data: There are no missing values for this data. Missing values plot for United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State overTime: Overall, there are only 21 distinct missing pattern for nearly 40000 rows of data. In particular, less than half of the rows are complete cases. Total confirmed death, total probable death, total probable cases and total confirmed cases have the highest numbers of missing data, where the percent of missing values are roughly identical to about 20 percent. These four variables often have missing values at the same time. Around 15 percent of total rows only have these four variables missing at the same time. Percent of missing consent cases and consent deaths are roughly identical. Pecent of missing new probable cases and new probable deaths are also roughly identical. The missing percentage for these four variables are also significant, but they are a lot lower than the previous four attributes, where all other attributes have no missing data. There are also some correlations between variables. Consent cases and consent death variable indicates if the state consent to disclosure the data on cases and deaths. There are three values: ‘agree’, ‘not agree’ and NA (the missing value). After understanding the variable, we found that when consent cases is missing, total probable cases and total confirmed cases are missing as well. Same thing happen to consent deaths， total probable deaths and total confirmed deaths. Therefore, after the missing value analysis, we can conclude that missing values in consent cases and consent deaths is equivalent to ‘not agree’. And now the consent cases and consent death can be translate to a logical variable having 0 and 1 as values.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CPI 5.2 Covid", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CPI CDC trend The above line chart shows the change of CPI for different items by time. Since there are so many items, we choose the ones we are most interested in to look more closely. We choose “energy”,“private transportation”, “private transportation”, “Commodities”, “new vehicles”, “public transportation”, and “communication” for futher discuss. Heatmap According to the heat map, we can easily tell that many of the CPI items are highly and positively correlated with each other. However, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities, Communication, and Apparel showed white and red color in the heat map. This indicates that they are not or negatively correlated with other items. Combining with the trend graph, I know that their prices did not increase much. It is also reasonable because some of them have pricing mechanism that is not determined by the market. For instance, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities and Communication have government set prices and fixed prices. We can see that the items can be divided into four groups from the above line chart. “energy”,“private transportation” and “transportation” decreases during the begining of covid-19 and then rises until now. “commodities” and “new vehicles” rises steadily. “public transportation” decreases slowly and then rise sharply during the start of 2021, then decrease sharply. “communication” almost no change. 5.2 Covid 5.2.1 new cases and total cases change by State from 2020 Jan to 2021 Nov We compared how new cases and total cases change from 1976 to 2020 by state Instructions to use the graph: Play/pause clicking the play/pause button Navigate the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb Navigate the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys. From the above motion map, we can see that the first five cases in the United States come from Illinois State, Washington State and Arizona State. At the beginning, California and New York state has the most new cases which are two of the largest States that have the most population. From Jun 2020 to Sep 2020, California, Texas and Florida States have the most new cases. Then New York comes with them to have the most new cases. Because the population for these states are really large which increases the spread of Coronavirus disease. From the motion map, we can find that at first, New York is the state with the largest total cases and then from Jul 2020 until Nov 2021, California, Texas and Florida are the three States that have the largest total cases which compatible with the trend of new cases from the previous motion map. These three States have large populations and warm weather which provides with enough condition for Coronavirus to live and spread. From the above two motion graphs, we have an opinion that the California, Texas and Florida have really similar trends. We would also like to know whether other states share the same trend. We are going to cluster the States into several regions by covid trend in the following sessions. 5.2.2 Correlation CPI V.S. Covid-19 Cases By looking at the pair-wise correlation between our variables(Covid data and CPI data), I am trying to use a quantitative method to find similar curves. Especially the curves that have similar trend as the total covid-19 cases. The results 5.2.3 cluster To identify difference and similarities between covid case curves, we estimated a basis spline (B-spline) model for every state. Each estimated B-spline is a weighted piecewise combination of 10 polynomials, connected at “knots”. Estimated splines and weight coefficients are closely related in states with similar underlying case curves. We compared the estimated state splines by using the K-means algorithm to cluster similar sets of weight coefficients, identifying groups of states with similar covid case trajectories. In general, we can observe that the coefficients for two states in the same cluster are more similar than those in a different cluster(e.g. Florida and Texas). The above us map demonstrates the color distribution of all the states in the US, where the states with the same color have closer coefficients and thus similar spline curves. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.0.1 bar plot From the bar plot, we can see that public transportation is the only one that decreases the CPI after the Covid-19. Because of the Covid-19, many people avoided using pubilic transportation which is crowded. The decrease of demands decreased the CPI. In the opposite, private transportation, Energy and transportation CPI increases a lot after the Covid-19 comparing with the change rates before the Covid-19. More people choose to use private transportation to reduce the chance of exposure to the crowds. We already know that energy is a necessity for private transportation. The increase of demands on these three products increases the CPI at the same time. Durable goods is the one that has negative change in CPI before the Covid-19 and then increases sharply after the Covid-19. We know that during the Covid-19, people are forced to stay at home and this may be the reason that people bought lots of durable goods to prevent emergencies. From the above line chart, we can see that before the covid-19, the supply of oil increases steadily. At the begining of Covid, from Mar 2020 to May 2020, the oil production decreases charply which shares the same trend with travel number. The decrease of needs for travel leads to the decrease of needs for energy, leads to the decrease of energy CPI and finally cause the decrease of supply. Then the production increases slowly, though there is still some decreases, finally tend to steady now. From the CPI of Energy plot and the travel number plot, we can see that both of them increases from Jan 2021 until now. The increase of needs for travel increases the needs for energy. The extra needs for energy and the shortage of energy production together makes the energy CPI increase. ## # A tibble: 6 × 6 ## `Date Administered` AgeGroupVacc `7-day_avg_group_ca… Administered_Dose1_… Series_Complete_Po… date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM &lt;12 Years 6.80 0.075 0.003 2021-11-23 ## 2 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 12 - 15 Years 6.46 0.587 0.488 2021-11-23 ## 3 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 25 - 39 Years 7.59 0.716 0.609 2021-11-23 ## 4 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 40 - 49 Years 6.88 0.797 0.693 2021-11-23 ## 5 11/23/2021 12:00:00 AM 50 - 64 Years 5.81 0.869 0.764 2021-11-23 ## 6 11/22/2021 12:00:00 AM &lt;12 Years 9.35 0.075 0.003 2021-11-22 "],["results-1.html", "Chapter 8 Results 8.1 Covid Development in U.S. 8.2 Covid Development in Different States 8.3 Clustering States by Covid Trend 8.4 Consumer Price Index Development 8.5 Covid’s Impact on Energy Price Index", " Chapter 8 Results 8.1 Covid Development in U.S. 8.1.1 Cases Trend Line 8.1.1.1 Cumulative Total Cases 8.1.1.2 Daily New Cases 8.2 Covid Development in Different States We compared how new cases and total cases change from 1976 to 2020 by state Instructions to use the graph: Play/pause clicking the play/pause button Navigate the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb Navigate the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys.

From Jun 2020 to Sep 2020, California, Texas and Florida States have the most new cases. Then New York comes with them to have the most new cases.

These three States have large populations and warm weather which provides with enough condition for Coronavirus to live and spread. 8.3 Clustering States by Covid Trend 8.4 Consumer Price Index Development 8.4.1 Chang of Living Expenses by Items From the bar plot, we can see that public transportation is the only one that decreases the CPI after the Covid-19. Because of the Covid-19, many people avoided using pubilic transportation which is crowded. The decrease of demands decreased the CPI. In the opposite, private transportation, Energy and transportation CPI increases a lot after the Covid-19 comparing with the change rates before the Covid-19.

Durable goods is the one that has negative change in CPI before the Covid-19 and then increases sharply after the Covid-19. We know that during the Covid-19, people are forced to stay at home and this may be the reason that people bought lots of durable goods to prevent emergencies. 8.4.2 8.4.3 Correlation Between Consumer Items From the first graph with all CPI items, it is hard for us to tell clearly how each one moves. And by their names and our common sense, it is very likely that some of them share similar trend. Therefore, we decided to use a heat map to represent their correlations so that we can evaluate their similarities quantitatively. Our purpose here is to find similarities and group similar ones so that we can find the main cause of higher prices easier. According to the heat map, we can easily tell that many of the CPI items are highly and positively correlated with each other. However, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities, Communication, and Apparel showed white and red color in the heat map. This indicates that they are not or negatively correlated with other items. Combining with the trend graph, I know that their prices did not increase much. It is also reasonable because some of them have pricing mechanism that is not determined by the market. For instance, Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities and Communication have government set prices and fixed prices. Energy are highly correlated with some other industrial and transportation related items. According to the heatmap, I would group the following items together: Energy, Commodities, Transportation, Private Transportation, Durables and Fuel and Utilities. The rest of items are Food, Education, Housing, Medical Care Services and Recreation. Their correlation are higher than 0.8 indicating a high correlation between them. Their prices are highly affected by labor cost in services area. Since our living expenses increased, people working at services industry would need higher salaries and results in higher price for services. Moreover, their correlation with Energy is relatively low. Just like I explained before, it would take time to have effect on those prices. People would first feel the living expense to increase before they ask for higher salary. The delaying effect caused the correlation between them and Energy to be low. Therefore, we grouped similar CPI items together and will show their similarities in the next part. 8.4.4 Group CPI Items The groups we created for CPI items are as follows: 1. Price Stable Items: Public Transportation, Medical Care Commodities, Communication, and Apparel 2. Energy Related Items: Energy, Commodities, Transportation, Private Transportation, Durables and Fuel and Utilities 3. Labor Related Goods: Food, Education, Housing, Medical Care Services and Recreation In order to confirm their similarities, their trend lines are plotted together below. Since their base values are different, the difference in scale would cause some trends not as obvious as others with larger scale. The standardized method is used here to showcase the similarities better. From the scaled trend lines, it proves that our grouping did a pretty good job! Price Stable Items had price drop since early 2019 and started to rise in price after mid 2020. Energy Related Items had a increase trend in early 2019 and had a huge drop after Covid broke out and increase in price afterwards dramatically. Labor Related Items had a general increasing trend since 2019, and had a higher slop after Covid broke out. The last graph showed one item from each of three groups to showcase their difference in trend as response to the Covid development. According to the trends of different groups, Energy Related Items are more interesting to us. Their price dropped a lot after Covid just broke out. And then, the price increased dramatically after the first several months. Other goods, doesn’t seem to have such big impact from Covid. Therefore, we think Energy Related Items will be the target we will further investigate so as to discover how Covid caused our living expense to increase. 8.5 Covid’s Impact on Energy Price Index 8.5.1 Covid &amp; Energy Trend Comparison We have scaled the data so as to make their changes obvious and comparable. At beginning of 2020, Energy started to drop from 0 which is its mean to over -1.5 times its standard deviation. At the end of 2020, though Total Cases was still growing, Energy price started to recover and increase to higher level than before Covid broke out. 8.5.2 Change of Energy Price Index Next, we are going to investigate the probable reason that Covid could cause Energy price to change like what we discovered. We would discuss the cause from supply perspective and demand perspective. changedate = Monthly_Transportation_Statistics %&gt;% mutate(change=c(0,diff(travel)), val = c(lag(travel,12))) changedate\\(val = changedate\\)travel-changedate$val changedate &lt;- changedate %&gt;% mutate(val = if_else(is.na(val), 0, val)) From the plot, we can see that before the Covid-19, the travel number increase steadily until February. At the begining of the Covid-19, from February 2020 to April 2020, the travel decreases sharply which follows the tread that CPI for energy decreases sharply from Jan 2020 to March 2020, and then CPI for energy rises a little in July 2020, stay until Dec 2020, and a slight decrease in Dec 2020. From the travel trend plot, we can also see that the travel number has a slow increase from April 2020 to February 2021. The CPI for energy and air travel number both increase from Jan 2021 until now.
